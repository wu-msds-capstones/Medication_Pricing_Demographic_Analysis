# Conclusions

Our analysis reveals significant geographic disparities in Medicare Part D drug pricing across the United States. While our data does not conclusively demonstrate that these pricing variations disproportionately affect any single demographic group, the inconsistencies raise serious concerns about the effectiveness and equity of Medicare’s price negotiation mechanisms. The observed variation suggests that drug costs could be more uniformly regulated, pointing to inefficiencies in the current system.

For many Medicare beneficiaries—particularly older adults and individuals with limited resources—the burden of navigating complex plan options to secure affordable coverage is substantial. Despite the availability of plan finder tools and licensed advisors, the process remains daunting for a population that the program is intended to support. This complexity undermines the accessibility and fairness of Medicare Part D.  

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 marked a pivotal step toward addressing unsustainable drug pricing. Regulatory intervention, as demonstrated by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the CMS [@cms2025negotiation], has shown potential to curb excessive price increases. In December 2024, CMS [@cms2024inflationrebate] announced cost savings for 64 drugs whose prices had outpaced inflation—an encouraging sign of progress. However, the full impact of these measures remains uncertain. Much of the projected savings will not materialize until 2026, and their effectiveness will depend on pharmaceutical industry responses, future pricing trends, and the extent to which affected medications are utilized.

To promote greater equity and transparency, federal and state policymakers could collaborate to ensure that the lowest negotiated drug prices are made broadly accessible, rather than confined to specific plans or contracts. There is a clear opportunity to advance price normalization and improve the transparency of treatment costs, which would better serve Medicare beneficiaries and strengthen the integrity of the program.

Price normalization across Medicare Part D plans could have far-reaching benefits beyond the immediate Medicare population. By reducing regional and plan-based disparities, normalization would help create a more predictable and equitable pricing environment for all stakeholders, including providers, pharmacies, and insurers. It could also reduce administrative overhead associated with managing complex pricing structures and improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery.

Normalized pricing could help curb overall healthcare spending by discouraging price inflation and promoting competitive pricing among pharmaceutical manufacturers. When drug prices are consistent and transparent, it becomes easier for policymakers and researchers to evaluate cost-effectiveness, identify inefficiencies, and implement targeted reforms. This could lead to better resource allocation and improved public health outcomes.
