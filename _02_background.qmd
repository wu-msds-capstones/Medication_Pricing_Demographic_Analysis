# Background

## Previous research

Within the US, a 2009 study called “Variation in Drug Prices at Pharmacies: Are Prices Higher in Poorer Areas?” [@gellad2009variation], the authors looked at the mean retail prices for four target medications across Florida and compared those to the median ZIP code income from the 2000 census. They found that across the four drugs, the mean prices in the poorest ZIP codes were 9 percent higher than the statewide average.

Internationally, there are also significant drug price disparities. A 2021 report from the United States Government Accountability Office [@gao2021_21_282] found that “U.S. Prices for Selected Brand Drugs Were Higher on Average than Prices in Australia, Canada, and France”. On average, the drugs were more expensive in the US, with some drugs as much as 10 times higher and others a little lower than the maximum from other countries. 

## Factors that Influence Medication Affordability

According to [@ncbi_nbk493090], many factors affect medication affordability. The factors that seem most important for our investigation are “the interaction of market power, health insurance, and the lack of effective incentives for controlling product price”, “unequal bargaining power between buyers and sellers”, “insurance benefit designs with significant patient cost-sharing provisions”, and “inadequate performance of patient assistance programs and other public programs intended to make medicines more affordable for patients.” For consumers, few levers exist to lower costs. One option is choosing where to purchase medications, though this assumes access to multiple pharmacies and the ability to travel. The other is selecting a health insurance plan, but the availability of plan options varies widely by region. In many cases, geographic location, something individuals often cannot control, significantly limits affordable choices.

## Data landscape 

Medication prices vary depending on one’s insurance plan, the pharmacy, the dosage of medication, generic or name-brand, and more.  When looking for medication prices for our analysis, we initially explored several APIs from online pharmacies, including GoodRx [@goodrx2025] and CostPlusDrugs [@costplusdrugs2025], which aim to improve consumer price transparency. However, these sources could not be reliably linked to the county-level demographic data essential to our analysis. 

Consequently, we turned to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which offers one of the most comprehensive public datasets on healthcare coverage and drug pricing. CMS maintains over 100 datasets spanning prescription costs, plan structures, and beneficiary demographics [@cms2025data]. One Medicare-based dataset in particular allowed for medication pricing to be tied to geographic location, which we hoped to pair with demographic data. Three additional datasets from CMS provide access to overall drug spending at the national level. These datasets, covering the years 2019 through 2023, provide high-level insights into Medicare and Medicaid expenditures, including spending under Medicare Part D, Medicare Part B, and Medicaid. While this data lacks the geographic granularity needed for county-level analysis, it offers valuable context by identifying medications with the greatest national impact based on total cost.

For demographic data, the most obvious choice is to use the demographic data collected every 10 years by the US Census.  [@uscensus2025] 

## Medicare Overview

Medicare eligibility generally requires individuals to be age 65 or older, although those with disabilities, end-stage renal disease (ESRD), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) may qualify earlier [@medicareEligibility]. Once someone is age-eligible, they must sign up for Medicare coverage (Parts A, B, and D) within ± 3 months of their 65th birthday else face late enrollment penalties. 
Medicare has four primary parts. [@medicareParts]
Part A (Hospital Insurance) - This covers inpatient care in hospitals, skilled nursing facility care, hospice care, and home health care.
Part B (Medical Insurance) - This covers regular doctors visits, outpatient care, home health care, durable medical equipment, and many preventative services.
Part D (Drug Coverage) - This covers the cost of prescription drugs. 
Medigap (Medicare Supplemental Insurance - only eligible with Original Medicare)
There are several different methods to purchase some combination of the parts above. The two primary methods are: (1) through “Original Medicare” which bundles Part A and B, and Part D must be purchased separately or (2) thru a Medicare Advantage Plan (referred to as Part C) which bundles Parts A, B, and D together and is often thru private insurers.

## Medicare Part D (Drug Coverage) Costs

Since our focus will be on medication costs, let’s do a deeper dive into Medicare Part D. Depending on the specific plan, one could pay a premium (fixed monthly cost no matter how much the plan is used), a deductible (an amount one pays before the plan starts to pay, a max of $590 in 2025 down to no deductible), a copayment (a fixed amount ones pay at the pharmacy), and/or coinsurance (a percentage one pays at the pharmacy). [@medicarePartDCosts] The specific medication and dosage combination one takes will have different prices at every pharmacy and will have different prices within the same pharmacy depending on the chosen Medicare plan. Some medications are not covered by all plans. Since the average person at age 65 is likely to be on more than one prescription medication, this is a lot of factors to consider when choosing the best plan and pharmacy to minimize costs. This level of complication explains why so many 65-year-olds experience confusion in the process of having to go on Medicare.
