# Abstract

Escalating pharmaceutical prices in the United States present a significant barrier to healthcare access and exacerbate financial strain on patients. This study investigates geographic and demographic disparities in prescription drug costs by analyzing Medicare Part D plan pricing at the county level. To manage and analyze over 100 GB of complex data, we developed a scalable data engineering pipeline utilizing AWS S3, DuckDB, and the Parquet file format. The pipeline integrates datasets from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). 

We applied statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to examine how demographic and market factors influence drug pricing. Our findings reveal that the number of available Medicare plans in a county is the most influential predictor of price for the majority of drugs studied, underscoring the impact of market dynamics over direct demographic characteristics. While certain demographic variables—such as median income, education level, and racial composition—showed predictive relevance for specific medications, no single demographic factor consistently explained price variation across all drugs.

Although our analysis does not conclusively demonstrate disproportionate pricing impacts on any one demographic group, it highlights a complex and inequitable pricing landscape. These insights challenge the efficacy of current Medicare price negotiation mechanisms and suggest that federal and state policymakers should pursue price normalization strategies. Ensuring that the lowest negotiated drug prices are broadly accessible could enhance transparency and affordability for all Medicare beneficiaries.

# Introduction

Escalating pharmaceutical prices in the U.S. are reshaping public health policy, widening healthcare disparities, and straining the financial well-being of millions. A recent KFF poll found that 60% of adults take at least one prescription, and 25% take four or more [@KFF2024]. Yet, as pharmaceutical technology advances, affordability remains a significant concern. Even with coverage through Medicare, Medicaid, or private insurance, many patients face high out-of-pocket costs that contribute to financial stress and, in some cases, treatment avoidance. 

According to the Commonwealth Fund [@TCF2025], 30% of U.S. adults carry medical debt, and nearly 57% of under-insured adults delay or avoid necessary treatment due to cost. This financial strain is compounded by the fragmented structure of public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which serve only specific populations and vary widely by state and county. These regional differences in plan availability and coverage often translate into significant disparities in pricing and out-of-pocket costs, further undermining equitable access to care.

While medications are only one aspect of medical care, they are essential in preventing more costly interventions. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and kidney disease can often be effectively managed with medication, reducing the need for hospitalization or surgery. A recent study by UNC Health [@unc2025semaglutide] found that oral semaglutide (marketed as Ozempic and Rybelsus for diabetes, and Wegovy for weight loss) significantly lowered the risk of heart attacks and strokes. This underscores that medication affordability is not merely a matter of convenience but a foundation of equitable, cost-effective healthcare.

This project examines the costs associated with Medicare prescription drug plans and their impact on different demographic groups across the U.S. By analyzing how plan pricing varies by state and county, we aim to better understand the financial burden on under-served populations. The findings will highlight geographic and socioeconomic disparities in medication affordability and may inform policy changes, or targeted interventions to advance health equity.

To support this analysis, we integrated publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). These datasets provide detailed information on drug pricing, clinical use, demographic characteristics, and public insurance coverage specifically for Medicare patients.  We brought together all datasets into a single DuckDB database on AWS S3, allowing for efficient and scalable data queries. This setup supports a thorough investigation of drug spending patterns and helps model costs based on demographic factors.
