Sadly, the responsibility for many Medicare dependents is that they must carefully review Medicare plans in order to ensure they have the best coverage for their medical needs.  They have to leverage plan finder tools and licensed advisors to find the most cost effective plans.  However, for a program that is designed to support the elderly and those in need, the asks are significant. 

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022[6] was one step towards attempting to reign in some of the unsustainable drug cost issues.  There is evidence to show that regulatory engagement in negotiations can help to mitigate the increasing costs of medication treatment modalities.  The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) through CMS announced in December 2024 cost savings for 64 drugs, for some Medicare recipients, whose prices were being raised faster than the already high rate of inflation [7].  Unfortunately, limited objective data and information is available to better understand the actual impact of this legislation.  Much of the savings from renegotiated prices will not take effect until 2026.  The actual impact will ultimately depend on how drug companies respond, how prices evolve and how many people use the impacted medications.
