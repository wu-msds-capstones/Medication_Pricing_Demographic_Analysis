# Introduction
The rising cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States presents significant implications for public health policy, equity in healthcare access, and the financial well-being of diverse populations. This capstone project investigates the central research question: _"How have pharmacy costs evolved over the past half decade across U.S. demographic groups, and what trends can be forecast for the next five years?"_ To address this, we integrate publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), capturing detailed information on drug prices, clinical indications, population demographics, and coverage programs. These data were ingested and harmonized into a unified DuckDB instance hosted on AWS S3 cloud storage, enabling scalable, query-efficient analysis across large, heterogeneous datasets. (Thanks Prof. Rembold!) This infrastructure supports a multi-faceted exploration of pharmaceutical spending patterns and sets the stage for rigorous, demographic-driven cost modeling.
