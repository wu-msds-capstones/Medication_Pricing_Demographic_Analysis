# Quarto Starting Template for MSDS Capstone Writeup

The files provided within should provide a starting point for an organizational scheme and template for writing your capstone. Everything can be shifted or changed as needed or you see fit: this is just a starting point.

This template already has an orphaned gh-pages repo created, so all that is necessary for HTML publication is to activate it in the repo settings (DONE) and then publish to it from the Quarto CLI (follow the instructions below).

To update the gh-pages branch (aka the published webpage), you can use the following command from this folder in your terminal/command line:

```bash/terminal
quarto publish gh-pages
```
