# Introduction
The rising cost of pharmaceuticals in the United States presents significant implications for public health policy, equity in healthcare access, and the financial well-being of diverse populations. This capstone project investigates the central research question: _"How have pharmacy costs evolved over the past half decade across U.S. demographic groups, and what trends can be forecast for the next five years?"_ To address this, we integrate publicly available data from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the U.S. Census Bureau, and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), capturing detailed information on drug prices, clinical indications, population demographics, and coverage programs. These data were ingested and harmonized into a unified DuckDB instance hosted on AWS S3 cloud storage, enabling scalable, query-efficient analysis across large, heterogeneous datasets. This infrastructure supports a multi-faceted exploration of pharmaceutical spending patterns and sets the stage for rigorous, demographic-driven cost modeling.

Medication usage is a reality that touches nearly every American. According to a KFF (formerly Kaiser Family Foundation) research poll, 60% of adults report taking at least one prescription medication, and 25% take four or more prescribed medications [1]. As pharmaceutical technology continues to advance, the affordability of these medications remains a significant concern for those who rely on them to manage a wide range of health conditions.

Medications are often the first line of treatment for both chronic and acute medical diagnoses, and they are a major driver of healthcare costs. Consider how frequently a provider recommends a medication—or a combination of medications—as the initial response to a diagnosis. For many Americans, the financial burden of these treatments contributes to stress and anxiety, especially within the framework of a largely privatized healthcare system. Even with insurance, Medicare, or Medicaid, the out-of-pocket costs for a prescription regimen can be substantial.

According to the Commonwealth Fund, an estimated 30% of adults carry medical debt. Alarmingly, nearly 57% of underinsured adults report delaying or avoiding necessary treatment due to cost [2]. This issue is further complicated by the structure of public insurance programs like Medicare and Medicaid, which are only available to specific segments of the population. These programs also vary significantly by state and county, with plan options that can dramatically affect both pricing and individual financial responsibility. As a result, geographic and demographic disparities continue to challenge equitable access to care.

While medications are just one component of medical treatment, they play a critical role in preventing more costly interventions down the line. For example, chronic conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and chronic kidney disease can often be managed effectively with medication, reducing the need for hospitalization or surgery. A recent study by UNC Health found that oral semaglutide (Brand names: Ozempic and Rybelsus for diabetes, and Wegovy for weight loss) significantly reduced the incidence of heart attacks and strokes [3]. This highlights the importance of medication affordability—not just as a matter of convenience, but as a cornerstone of equitable and effective healthcare.

This project aims to explore the costs associated with Medicare medication plans and how those costs impact the various demographics across the U.S. By examining the structure and variability of Medicare plan pricing—particularly how they differ by state and county—we can better understand the financial burden placed on disadvantaged populations. This analysis will highlight disparities in access and affordability, and seek to identify patterns that may inform policy improvements or targeted interventions to promote more equitable healthcare outcomes.
