# Analysis

## Scope of Analysis:
One of the first goals was to understand the connected data at a high level by condensing and aggregating details. Due to the granularity of the formulary data, it was necessary to narrow the focus rather than analyze all 6,000+ medications. The CMS spending datasets (Part B, Part D, and Medicaid) provided a clearer, structured view and helped identify high-impact drugs. Using this data, we generated top drug lists by total spend, claims, and doses (@fig-topspend), ultimately selecting a few key medications for deeper analysis.

For the rest of the analysis, we plan to use these top drugs by the most absolute spend in 2019-2023. To help contextualize what these medications treat, see the table below.

## Overview of Analysis:
Afte mapping individual medication prices to counties across the U.S. by way of which Medicare plans were available in each county, we discovered that drugs can have a lot more variance in pricing than we even imagined. The most variable drug had over 6k unique prices across the country, with many in the 4k range. To statistically simplify, we took the median across all 30-day supply prices for each drug (9-digit NDC code) within each county. Note: 60-day and 90-day prices were also available, but were filtered out to simplify the overall analysis. A box plot of the top medications by total spend are shown below descending from the most spend to the least spend.  {@fig-pricevariance} This shows the variance in drug prices. Note that the absolute cost of the medication doesn’t correlate with the total nationwide spend for that medication. The drug with the top overall spend (Apixaban) is one of the cheapest at ~$10 per 30-day supply, while another drug in the top overall spend is VERY expensive at ~$26k per 30-day supply.

Not all these prices are available to every Medicare patient in the US. An individual’s price options depend on their county of residence. To further showcase the variance at a county level, below is a bar chart showing the number of medicare plans available within a sample state by county. (@fig-ORplans)
